# Ubuntu setup and dotfiles

The files in this repository are used to setup a fresh Ubuntu installation as a developer machine.  
In order to start the setup, only the `bootstrap.sh` script needs to be run.  
The script should not be run as root.  

After the script has finished, the computer needs to be restarted.  
When the login screen appears, select your user and change the desktop environment to `i3` using the settings icon in the bottom right corner.
